# Ambient sensor station
This station implements basic ambient sensing functionalities including temperature, humidity, pressure, air quality and brightness.

The main intent for me is to use this inside e.g. the living or sleeping room. However the basis without the air quality sensor can be used in many other rooms or scenarios as well.

Note: As this is developed to work in a productive environment the system uses the "deep sleep" state of the ESP8266.

Note: The values in this scenario are transmitted on multiple different MQTT channels as single values. This makes it simple but a switch to JSON based is planned for the future.

## Components

* Adafruit TSL2561 sensor ([Documentation](https://www.adafruit.com/product/439))

## Connection
* BME280 @ SPI
* CCS811 + TSL2561 @ I2C
