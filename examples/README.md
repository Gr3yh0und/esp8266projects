# Sensor and actor examples
This directory lists all the examples that should help getting started with sensors, actors and the NodeMCU. 
The main intent is to get all devices working first and combine them for more complex projects afterwards.

## Sensors
* [water flow sensor](flowsensor)
* [dust sensor](dustsensor)
* [ambient sensor](bme280)
* [brightness sensor](tsl2561)
* [air quality sensor](ccs811)
* [capacitive sensor](capacitivesensor)
* [sound level sensor](soundlevel)

## Actors
* [4 channel relay module](relay)
* SSD 1306 OLED display 128x64px
* [DFplayer mini](dfplayer)
* [WS2812 12-LED ring](ledring)
* [capacitive button](capacitivebutton)

## Network related
* [Over the air update](ota)
* [Syslog server](syslog)
* [MQTT](mqtt)
