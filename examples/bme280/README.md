# Bosch BME280 ambient sensor
This example should provide a first start to work with the Bosch BME280 ambient sensor which is e.g. produced by Adafruit.

It is capable of reading temperature, ambient pressure and humidity at once with a quite high precision. And its cheap. So one sensor to rule them all.

I'm using it with the SPI connection in this example.

## Components
